/**
 * Class Baby:
 *  The Baby class represents a Baby object with the following properties,
 *  in protected internal variables named:
 *      String _firstName,
 *      String _lastName,
 *      String _id (the id mumber),
 *      Date _dateOfBirth,
 *      Weight _birthWeight,
 *      Weight _currentWeight.
 *  
 *  The class has 2 constructors:
 *  - A constructor that allows to set the data of the baby by providing:
 *      first name, last name, id (up to 9 digits), day, month and year 
 *      of birth, weight at birth in grams.
 *      The constructor does not checks the validity of the date but it will be
 *      done by the constructor of the Date class, and if it is not a valid date
 *      it is set to 01/01/2024.
 *      The constructor does not checks the validity of weight but it will be
 *      done by the constructor of the Weight class, and if it is not a valid weight
 *      it is set to 1 kilo.
 *  - A constructor that copies a valid Baby object.
 *  
 *  The class has 6 retrieving methods to get the internal values of the Baby:
 *      String getFirstName(), String getLastName(), String getId(),
 *      Date getDateOfBirth(),
 *      Weight getBirthWeight(), Weight getCurrentWeight()
 *
 *  The class has 1 setting method to set the current weight of the baby:
 *      void setCurrentWeight(Weight weightToSet)
 *
 *  The class utilities methods:
 *  - A method to compare another baby to this object looking at 3 properties only:
 *          First and Last names and id
 *      boolean equals(Baby other)
 *  - A method to compare another baby to this object to check if they are twins by looking at
 *          3 properties only:
 *          Last names must be equal,
 *          First name and Id must not be equal,
 *          Date of birth must be within one day apart (0 or 1 day)
 *      boolean areTwins(Baby other)
 *  - A method to check if the weight of this baby is heavier than the weight of another baby.
 *      boolean heavier(Baby other)
 *  - A method to check if the date of birth of this baby is before than the date of birth of another baby.
 *      int older(Baby other)
 *  - A method to set the current weight of the baby, only if the grams to add are valid.
 *      void setCurrentWeight(Weight weightToSet)
 *  - A method to check if the current weight of this baby is within the valid range based on
 *      it's age, given by the parameter numOfDays, and it's current weight, and compared to
 *      standard medical accepted changes in baby weight during it's first year.
 *      int isWeightInValidRange(int numOfDays)
 *  - A method to get the object as a string in a formatted form
 *      String toString()
 *
 *  The class has 1 helper internal (private) methods:
 *  - A method to check that the id is a string of length 9 otherwise returns "000000000"
 *      String checkId(String id)
 *
